    # --- OOP KNOWLEDGE DOMAIN ---
    "oop_definition": "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects' containing data (attributes) and code (methods). The **4 Pillars of OOP** are:\n1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods into a single class.\n2. **Abstraction**: Exposing essential features while hiding internal complexity.\n3. **Inheritance**: Creating new child classes from existing parent classes for code reuse.\n4. **Polymorphism**: Allowing different objects to respond to the same method call in their own specific way.",
    
    "procedural_vs_oop": "Procedural Programming vs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n- **Procedural**: Focuses on functions and step-by-step procedures operating on global/shared data (e.g., C, Pascal).\n- **OOP**: Focuses on objects encapsulating both data and methods, offering higher modularity, reusability, and access control.",

    "class_concept": "A **Class** is a blueprint or template that defines the attributes (data) and methods (behavior) that objects created from it will possess.",

    "object_concept": "An **Object** is a concrete instance of a class that holds actual values for attributes and can execute methods defined by its class.",

    "class_vs_object": "Class vs Object:\n- **Class**: The abstract blueprint or template (e.g., `Car` definition).\n- **Object**: A real instance created from that blueprint with specific state (e.g., `my_tesla = Car('Red', 'Model 3')`).",

    "attributes_vs_methods": "Attributes vs Methods:\n- **Attributes**: Variables stored inside an object representing its state or properties (e.g., `color`, `speed`).\n- **Methods**: Functions defined within a class that operate on an object's data (e.g., `drive()`, `brake()`).",

    "encapsulation": "Encapsulation is the OOP principle of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data inside a single unit (class), while restricting direct access to internal details using access modifiers.",

    "data_hiding": "Data Hiding is the practice of concealing internal object states (e.g., using `private` fields in Java or `__private` naming in Python) so external code cannot mutate attributes directly.",

    "encapsulation_vs_abstraction": "Encapsulation vs Abstraction:\n- **Encapsulation**: Hides data within an object to protect internal state (focuses on *how* data is secured).\n- **Abstraction**: Hides implementation complexity to expose simple interfaces (focuses on *what* an object does).",

    "abstraction": "Abstraction is the OOP pillar that hides complex background implementation details and exposes only essential interfaces to the user (e.g., pressing a car accelerator without knowing engine fuel dynamics).",

    "inheritance": "Inheritance allows a new class (child/derived) to acquire properties and behaviors from an existing class (parent/base), promoting code reusability.",

    "inheritance_types": "Common Inheritance Types:\n- **Single**: One child inherits from one parent.\n- **Multilevel**: A child inherits from a parent which inherits from a grandparent.\n- **Multiple**: A child inherits from multiple parent classes (Supported in Python, but restricted in Java using interfaces).\n- **Hierarchical**: Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent.\n- **Hybrid**: A combination of two or more inheritance types.",

    "polymorphism": "Polymorphism ('many forms') allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass, responding to the same method call according to their specific implementations.",

    "overloading_vs_overriding": "Method Overloading vs Method Overriding:\n- **Method Overloading**: Multiple methods in the *same class* share the same name but have different parameter signatures (Compile-Time Polymorphism).\n- **Method Overriding**: A child class provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its *parent class* (Runtime Polymorphism).",

    "interface_vs_abstract_class": "Interface vs Abstract Class:\n- **Interface**: Defines a pure contract of abstract methods with no state (all methods implicitly public/abstract).\n- **Abstract Class**: Can contain both abstract methods and concrete methods with instance variables.",

    "association_aggregation_composition": "Association, Aggregation, and Composition:\n- **Association**: General relationship between two independent objects.\n- **Aggregation**: 'Has-A' weak relationship where child objects can exist independently of the parent (e.g., Department and Teachers).\n- **Composition**: 'Has-A' strong relationship where child objects cannot exist if the parent is destroyed (e.g., House and Rooms).",

    "is_a_vs_has_a": "IS-A vs HAS-A Relationship:\n- **IS-A**: Based on Inheritance (e.g., `Dog` IS-A `Animal`).\n- **HAS-A**: Based on Composition/Aggregation (e.g., `Car` HAS-A `Engine`).",
